gpu-image provides a set of classes for simple image processing using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) within C#/XNA.  The GPU programs are written as effects files; some of which are dynamically generated.

The project may be used in one of three ways.

1: as a simple image viewer with very fast good quality pan/zoom

2: to experiment with simple image processing pipelines

3: to write C# (or other DotNet) image processing applications.

I am currently (4 May 2011) working on a Java equivalent using CL.  I do not expect to progress this C# version.  I will make the Java version available when it is in a fit state.
