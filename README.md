gpu-image provides a set of classes for simple image processing using a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) within C#/XNA.
The GPU programs are written as effects files; some of which are dynamically generated.

The project may be used in one of three ways :
 1. as a simple image viewer with very fast good quality pan/zoom
 2. to experiment with simple image processing pipelines
 3. to write C# (or other DotNet) image processing applications.
